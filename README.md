## Weather Forecast Dashboard

### Brief Description

The weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS to show the current day weather condition and forecast for the next 4 days based on a city.
A third party API is implemented for this application, which is [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
